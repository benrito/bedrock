    <h3>How the Add-on Works</h3>
    <p>
      Lightbeam visualizes online tracking behavior to allow the general public as well as privacy advocates to see who is tracking their movements across the Web. The Lightbeam Add-on enable individual users to see who tracks them in real time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Graph visualization helps show relationships across the web with adjustable filters that the user can control to visualize more types of data at a glance. The Clock visualization allows people to explore their own personal internet browsing history across the day. The List visualization is a simple tool for exploring the data collected by Lightbeam. 
    </p>
    <p>
      More site connection information is presented on the info panel on the right which shows more detailed information about the site, including what country it is registered in and what sites it has connected to or been connected from during the time period visualized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightbeam has site preferences which enable users to block sites from connecting to their Firefox browser,  watch sites they are interested in or hide sites they do not want to see visualized.

    <h2>The Origins of Lightbeam</h2>
    <p>
      In July 2011, Lightbeam began as a personal project by Atul Varma to help visualize tracking. After being inspired from the book, The Filter Bubble, he created this experimental add-on visualizes your browsing behaviour and data collection. In February 2012, Gary Kovacs gave a TED talk that introduced this add-on that exposes online tracking. Starting in September 2012, Mozilla collaborated with the SIM Centre to work with Emily Carr University of Art + Design students to further develop visualizations for the add-on. Over the past year, with the support of the Ford Foundation, the first version of Lightbeam will be launched in August 2013.

    <h2>Policy and the Larger Tracking Narrative</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to promote research further in the field of online tracking and privacy. We believing giving people the tools to begin making their own decisions about tracking and their online privacy while at the same time provides a valuable (and open) community research platform to reveal online tracking patterns to those who are likely to affect new standards of online privacy in the near term. We believe that the Add-on and the Lightbeam data server together make up an effective strategy to raise awareness regarding tracking behavior and ultimately may contribute to changing policy. Lightbeam will be a step in a larger, concerted effort by Mozilla and its partners to provide users with greater control of their personal data.
