    Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that allows you to see the third parties that are collecting information about your browsing activity, with and without your consent. Using interactive visualizations, Lightbeam shows you the relationships between these third parties and the sites you visit.

      After you download and install the Lightbeam add-on to Firefox, it will begin watching connections — giving you interactive visualizations of your browsing activity and how that data is being collected.

    <p>
      As you view the visualizations, you can take a closer look into the websites and their third party connections that are stored in your data. You can also reset or save your data to create your own visualizations.

    <h2>Tracking & privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience. But most tracking happens without users’ consent and without their knowledge. That’s not okay. It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.  <a href="{{ url('lightbeam.about') }}"> About Lightbeam »</a>

  <div class="span6">
    <h2>Explore the database</h2>
    <p>In the Lightbeam database, you will be able to browse first and third-party connection data uploaded by de-identified donors who use the Lightbeam add-on. We’re building this crowd-sourced directory to encourage users to visualize the state of tracking as an aggregate and to examine relationships that exist on the Web.
